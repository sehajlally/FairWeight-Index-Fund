# FairWeight-Index-Fund
Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index Fund

The purpose of this project was to create a (primarily) Python script that accepts values of a given portfolio as input, and then it outputs how many shares of the S&P 500 elements should be purchased to get a fair-weight-version of the index fund.

Pandas, Requests, xlsxwriter libraries (and more) were levraged in this project to pull information, organize, and store it in an Excel document.
